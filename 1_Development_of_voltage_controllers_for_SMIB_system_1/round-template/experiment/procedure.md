#### Step 7: Verify the results provided by the simulator against manual calculations.

### The Programming Interface:

#### Your task here is to form an appropriate algorithm for understanding the experiment's workflow.

#### For a pre-built structure, navigate to “PreBuilt”, and click it. After doing so, follow steps a - e:

#### Step a: Navigate to the “Help” button and click on it.

#### Step e: Now, run the simulation and verify the results.

#### For forming the algorithm yourself, follow steps 1-10:

#### Step 1: Navigate to the “Help” button and click on it.
