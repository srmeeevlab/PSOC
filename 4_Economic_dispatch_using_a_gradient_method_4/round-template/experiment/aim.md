To solve the economic dispatch problem by gradient technique if the fuel cost equation of thermal generating unit is highly non-linear.

&emsp; &emsp; Generally, the equal incremental principle is good only if the input-output characteristic of the generation unit is a quadratic function, or the incremental input-output characteristic is a piecewise linear function for solving the economic dispatch problem of the power system.  If the input-output characteristics of the practical power generating unit may be a cubic function, or more complex and nonlinear. In such case, the Gradient Method is used for solving the economic dispatch problems due to the highly nonlinear input-output characteristics (Fuel Vs Cost) of the power plant.
