The purpose of the electric utility or grid operator on an hour-by-hour basis is to lower the total cost of delivering electricity demand. The economic dispatch method uses the utility's selected method to meet the demand for electricity. Consider the following scenario for clearing the energy market: For the whole system, the utility creates a supply (marginal cost) curve. Demand is considered to be inelastic in terms of price (vertical demand curve). At the market-clearing point, the "System Lambda" is the marginal cost of producing anything (supply Equals demand). A "marginal unit" generator only provides enough electricity to meet a single kWh requirement. We'll go through the economic dispatch strategy using two different power production cost models. All marginal costs at power plants are considered to remain constant in the first model. The second implies that all marginal costs of power plants are linear (higher power results into an increase in the marginal cost). In the preceding sections, we explored the equal incremental concept for classical Economic dispatch (ED). 

CONCEPT

According to the equal incremental principle, the input-output characteristics of generating units will be a quadratic function. If the practical power producing unit's inputâ€“output characteristics are a cubic function or more complicated.  Hence this experiment address the issue of the non-linear cost function when the solution of the economic dispatch problem
