To estimate the current state from the last known value of the state vector using weighted least square method.

&emsp; &emsp; State Estimation is a process to estimate the electrical state of a network by eliminating inaccuracies and errors from measurement data. The output of the state estimator is therefore a set of voltage absolutes and voltage angles for all buses in the power system.
