To study the characteristics of solar energy for various temperature and solar irradiation.

&emsp; &emsp; In this experiment, the user simulates characteristics of a given solar panel rating through which the following Voltage Vs current and Power Vs Voltage plots are obtained. In addition to that, the user can know the maximum power generation, voltage, current of a solar panel for the input of the different temperatures and irradiance levels.
