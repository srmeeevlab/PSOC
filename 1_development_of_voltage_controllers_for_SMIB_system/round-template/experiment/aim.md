#### The aim of the experiment is development of voltage controllers for SMIB system.   
#### At the end of the experiment the student will able to,
1. Design the mathematical modelling of SMIB system.
2. Analyze the real and reactive power flow for different loading condition.
3. Design of reactive power compensator at receiving end.
