### Introduction<br>
### Simple Case<br>
#### To develop a good, qualitative understanding of the need for reactive-power control, let us consider a simple case of a lossless short-transmission line con necting a source V, to a load ZLø. (For simplicity, the line is represented only by its inductive reactance X,.) Figure 2.2 shows such a network with its param eters, as well as a phasor diagram showing the relationship between voltages and currents. From Fig. 2.2(b), it is clear that between the sending- and the receiving-end voltages, a magnitude variation, as well as a phase difference, is created. The most significant part of the voltage drop in the line reactance (AV₁ =jI,X₁) is due to the reactive component of the load current, I,. To keep the voltages in the network at nearly the rated value, two control actions seem possible:
#### 1. load compensation
#### 2. system compensation
