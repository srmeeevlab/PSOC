### INTRODUCTION<br>
 Solar cells are the fundamental building blocks of solar energy generating systems, since they collect electrical energy directly from light energy without any intermediary steps. A solar cell's operation is purely dependent on its photovoltaic effect, which is why it is also known as a photovoltaic cell. A semiconductor device is what a solar cell is. The voltage or potential difference established across the terminals of the solar cell is fixed at 0.5 volt and is nearly independent of the intensity of incident light, whereas the current capacity of the cell is nearly proportional to the intensity of incident light as well as the area that is exposed to the light. Solar cells, like all other types of battery cells, have one positive and one negative terminal. A solar or photovoltaic cell typically contains negative front and positive rear contacts. In the midst of these two connections lies a semiconductor p-n junction.

### Some photons of light are absorbed by the solar cell when sunlight falls on it. Some of the absorbed photons will have an energy larger than the energy gap between the semiconductor crystal's valence and conduction bands. As a result of receiving energy from one photon, one valence electron becomes excited and leaps out of the bond, forming an electron-hole pair. Light-generated electrons and holes are electrons and holes produced by e-h pairs. Due to the electrostatic force of the field across the junction, light-generated electrons near the p-n junction migrate to the n-type side of the junction. Due to the same electrostatic force, light-generated holes at the junction migrate to the p-type side of the junction. A potential difference is generated between two sides of the cell in this manner, and if these two sides are linked by an external circuit, current will flow from the solar cell's positive to negative terminal. This was the fundamental operating concept of a solar cell; now we'll go through the many aspects of a solar or photovoltaic cell that influence the solar panel's rating. It is critical to understand a solar panel's ratings when selecting a specific solar cell for a certain project. These numbers indicate how well a solar cell can convert light into energy.

### CONCEPT<br>

<br>

### Open Circuit Voltage of Solar Cell (Voc)<br>
 It is measured by measuring voltage across the terminals of the cell when no load is connected to the cell. This voltage depends upon the techniques of manufacturing and temperature but not fairly on the intensity of light and area of exposed surface. Normally open circuit voltage of solar cell nearly equal to 0.5 to 0.6 volt. It is normally denoted by Voc.
<br>

### Short Circuit Current of Solar Cell (Isc)<br>
 The maximum current that a solar cell can deliver without harming its own constriction. It is measured by short circuiting the terminals of the cell at most optimized condition of the cell for producing maximum output. The term optimized condition I used because for fixed exposed cell surface the rate of production of current in a solar cell also depends upon the intensity of light and the angle at which the light falls on the cell. As the current production also depends upon the surface area of the cell exposed to light, it is better to express maximum current density instead maximum current.

### Maximum Power Point of Solar Cell (Pm)<br>
 The maximum electrical power one solar cell can deliver at its standard test condition. If we draw the v-i characteristics of a solar cell maximum power will occur at the bend point of the characteristic curve. It is shown in the v-i characteristics of solar cell by Pm.<br>

### Current at Maximum Power Point (Im)<br>
 The current at which maximum power occurs. Current at Maximum Power Point is shown in the v-i characteristics of solar cell by Im.
<br>

### Voltage at Maximum Power Point (Vm)<br>
 The voltage at which maximum power occurs. Voltage at Maximum Power Point is shown in the v-i characteristics of solar cell by Vm.
<br>

### Fill Factor of Solar Cell (FF)<br>
 The ratio between product of current and voltage at maximum power point to the product of short circuit current and open circuit voltage of the solar cell.<br>

### Efficiency of Solar Cell<br>
### It is defined as the ratio of maximum )electrical power output to the radiation power input to the cell and it is expressed in percentage. It is considered that the radiation power on the earth is about 1000 watt/square metre hence if the exposed surface area of the cell is A then total radiation power on the cell will be 1000 A watts.<br>
