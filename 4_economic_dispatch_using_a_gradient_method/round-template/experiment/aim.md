#### The aim of the experiment is to determine the economic dispatch using a gradient method. 
#### The main objective of the experiments is about understanding the,
1. Deduce the incremental cost equation for the given thermal power plants.
2. Calculation of the real power output of each thermal power plant.
3. Examine the economic schedule among the power plants for a given loading demand including the transmission loss.
