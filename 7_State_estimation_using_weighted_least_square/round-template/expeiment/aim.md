#### The aim of the experiment is to determine the state estimation using weighted least square method. 
#### The main objective of the experiments is completely understanding the,
1.	Calculate the power flow of each line.
2.	Minimize the sum of the square of the weighted deviation of the estimated measurement from the actual measurement.
3.	Estimate the current state from the last known value of the state vector.
