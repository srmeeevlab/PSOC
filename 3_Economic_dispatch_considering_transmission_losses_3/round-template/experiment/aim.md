To estimate the economic schedule among the power plants for a given loading demand including the transmission loss.

&emsp; &emsp; Given a power system of thermal power generating units, determining how much power each unit should generate for a given demand including the network power loss while minimizing the total operational costs, which are generally expressed in nonlinear form.
